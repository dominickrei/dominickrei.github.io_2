Provide privacy by padding the packet to a size that is determined by a conditional distribution, $q(\\hat{\\mathcal{X}} = \\hat{x} | X = x)$. Where $\\hat{x}$ is the modified packet size and $\\hat{\\mathcal{X}}$ is the set of possible obfuscated packet sizes Define heuristics for utility.

Image data may contain sensitive information, such as face and iris, which can be misused if in the hands of an adversary. Widely used image obfuscation methods include blurring or mosaicing those sensitive  egions. However, they are prone to inference attacks, and do not provide quantifiable privacy guarantees. Recently, several image/video obfuscation approaches have been proposed  that satisfy the rigorous notion of differential privacy. In this work, we synthesize those approaches in the context of obfuscating face and iris images and analyze their privacy  guarantees. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of those methods regarding practical utility and privacy protection, with real-world face and iris image datasets. We  find that DP-SVD performs best on several privacy and utility measures while providing provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, we recommend practices for applying differentially  private image obfuscation to novel data requiring unique privacy and utility constraints","tags":[],"title":"A Comparative Evaluation for Differentially Private Image Obfuscation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"DP-Shield is an aggregation and comprehensive evaluation of differentially private image obfuscation techniques.\n","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"90ea0d89bc2c0c3cb42b5b676e57c307","permalink":"https://dominickrei.github.io/project/dpshield/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dpshield/","section":"project","summary":"An framework aggregationg and standardizing differentially private image obfuscation algorithms","tags":["Data Privacy","Machine Learning","Computer Vision"],"title":"DP-Shield","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SocialBit is a smartwatch app for classifying the social interaction of stroke patients.
